# Demography

Put JSON demography file to this directory. These demography files should follow the standards of demes, https://popsim-consortium.github.io/demes-spec-docs/main/introduction.html

The demography model that we are using is adapted from https://popsim-consortium.github.io/stdpopsim-docs/stable/catalog.html#sec_catalog_homsap_models_outofafricaarchaicadmixture_5r19, where we only included the following populations:

- Ancestral
- YRI
- OOA
- CEU
